# Headless Minecraft Kotlin (hl-mc-kt)

Inspired by [stevenarella](https://github.com/iceiix/stevenarella).

The goal is to have full chat support, movement support (for pathing), support for crafting things/interacting with the world so that this could be used as a bot for automation, it should also be lightweight and be threadable/connect to multiple servers at once or one server with multiple accounts.

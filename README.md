# Headless Minecraft Kotlin (hl-mc-kt)

The goal is to have full chat support, movement support (for pathing), support for crafting things/interacting with the world so that this could be used as a bot for automation, it should also be lightweight and be threadable/connect to multiple servers at once or one server with multiple accounts.
Uses [kt-cmd](https://github.com/willemml/kt-cmd) for the command system.
